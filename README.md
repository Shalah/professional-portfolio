# professional-portfolio

## Description
This is an updated version of the first portfolio that I made when I started coding. In this version are included a 'About Me' section, a 'My Work' section as well as a 'Contact Me' section. In the 'About Me' section, there are few information about myself. In the 'My Work' section, I included three projects I have worked on. One of those projects is the first group project and the other two are personal projects. Finally, in the last section there are various ways to get in contact with me.
